<h1>Breakfast</h1>
<p>We had some seaside porridge with abalone. Not the kind of breakfast I am used to, but if you like seafood, this is actually pretty good. This is traditional old-school Korean food, stuff your mom or grandma cooks up for breakfast. Try it if you want to eat like a Korean.</p>


<h1>Teddy Bear Museum (free)</h1>
<p>This area of the island has a lot of resorts and attractions for families and is very touristy/western. The Teddy Bear Musuem was celebrating its 20th anniversary, so admission was free for adults and children. And it was pouring rain, so perfect day for an indoor activity.</p>

<h1>The Planet</h1>
<p>Next, we headed over to The Planet. A small but neat exhibit about Earth. The exhibit is free, and the learning academy, where children can do arts and crafts with instructors, has a fee.</p>

<h1>The Beach</h1>
