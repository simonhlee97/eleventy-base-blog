<h1>Aqua Planet</h1>
<p>Aqua Planet is another nice attraction for families. Kids will enjoy the circus show on water, and have a chance to interact with some fish and marine animals. The giant sting ray is an amazing specimen, with a really friendly-looking smile. But perhaps most impressive about Aqua Planet is the location and amazing picturesque view just outside the food court. A great spot to take photos of the ocean and a crater in the background.</p>

<h1>Lunch: Han Sushi</h1>
<p>My wife and kids love sushi and Japanese food, so our lunch spot was another Japanese spot. Very typical menu, with donkatsu (fried pork), some raw-fish bibimbap, and some sashimi. Everything was good, and while I prefer the ramen we had last night, this place was not bad. After lunch, we headed to Big Beach again to let the kids play.</p>



<p>Final words: There's a lot more to see and do (and taste) on Jeju Island besides what I covered in these last 6 posts.</p>
<p>Jeju is a wonderful little island, full of options for every type of traveler. Beautiful beaches, great food, Korean street markets, plenty of mountains and hiking, a wide variety of hotels, pensions, and guest houses, and great urban and countryside balance. It would take at minimum 2 weeks to experience the entire island, so plan ahead and make an itinerary.</p>
