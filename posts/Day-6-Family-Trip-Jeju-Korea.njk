<h1>Pacific Land</h1>
<p>Pacific Land is another beautiful oceanside attraction for families.  is Pacific Land then drove over to Seogwipo, one of the largest cities on the island. There are parts of this city which are Seoul-like, with heavy traffic, street food and markets, Gangnam-style shopping, and high-rise apartments. Seogwipo has a really cool little art district, and an entire uphill street dedicated to a Korean artist, Lee Jeong-Sup.</p>

<h1>Lunch: Han Sushi</h1>
<p>My wife and kids love sushi and Japanese food, so our lunch spot was another Japanese spot. Very typical menu, with donkatsu (fried pork), some raw-fish bibimbap, and some sashimi. Everything was good, and while I prefer the ramen we had last night, this place was not bad. After lunch, we headed to Big Beach again to let the kids play.</p>
