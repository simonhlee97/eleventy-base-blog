<p>Born in Korea ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡·, and grew up in Hoosier country (Indiana) ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸.</p>

<p>I'm a part of that tribe of rednecks from Indiana trapped in a Korean man's body.</p>

<p>I love basketball (Pacers), tennis, reading, coding, photography, tacos, pizza, coffee, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, and Simon and Garfunkel.</p>

<p>As of now (July 2020) I'm currently stuck in South Korea due to COVID-19 (which is probably a good thing). I'll be moving back to the US in a year or two.</p>

## A bit more...

I was a math teacher in the US for a few years before deciding it was time to move on to a new career. I wanted a career "in the cloud," so I started learning web development on sites like Codecademy, Udemy, and [FreeCodeCamp.org](https://freecodecamp.org). I even went to a JavaScript bootcamp in Indiana, where I learned React, Angular, Node, git, and a lot more. I've done a little bit of freelancing while searching for a full-time job.

But this site is my non-techie blog, so topics will be limited to stuff like "life in Korea", photography, non-coding projects, and random thoughts and observations. I do all my web-development writing on [Dev.to](https://dev.to).

## For tech-nerds

I built this site with a static site generator, [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/). For styling, I chose [Bulma](https://bulma.io/), which paired really nicely with my blog. I tried out WordPress with shared hosting services like BlueHost and SiteGround, but they were too slow for my liking. I also considered Gatsby (React), Gridsome (Vue), but ultimately, decided to go with Eleventy because of the speed and being able to write posts in Markdown (no CMS necessary). This site is hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com).
