# A B O U T

Born in Korea, and grew up in Hoosier country (Indiana).

I'm a part of that tribe of rednecks from Indiana trapped in a Korean man's body.

I love basketball (Pacers), tennis, reading, coding, photography, tacos, pizza, and coffee.

As of now (June 2020) I'm currently stuck in South Korea due to COVID-19 (which is probably a good thing). I'll be moving back to the US in a year or two.

## Some of my favorite Podcasts, Blogs, etc.

* [Sam Harris](https://www.samharris.org)
* [Freakonomics](https://freakonomics.com)
* [Dan Pink](https://danpink.com)
* [Matt Mullenweg](https://ma.tt)

## A bit more...

I was a math teacher in the US for a few years before deciding it was time to move on to a new career. I wanted a career "in the cloud," so I started learning web development on sites like Codecademy, Udemy, and [FreeCodeCamp.org](https://freecodecamp.org). I even went to a JavaScript bootcamp in Indiana, where I learned React, Angular, Node, git, and a lot more. I've done a little bit of freelancing while searching for a full-time job.

This blog will include all topics except web development, because I do all my web-dev writing at [Dev.to](https://dev.to).

## For The Tech-Nerds

I built this site with a static site generator, [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/). I also considered Gatsby (React), Gridsome (Vue), but decided to go with Eleventy because of speed and after experimenting, I enjoyed developing with just MarkDown and Nunjucks templating. This site is hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com).
