<h1 class='has-text-centered'>A B O U T</h1>

<p>Born in Korea ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡·, and grew up in Hoosier country (Indiana) ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸.</p>

<p>I'm a part of that tribe of rednecks from Indiana trapped in a Korean man's body.</p>

<p>I love basketball (Pacers), tennis, reading, coding, photography, tacos, pizza, coffee, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, and Simon and Garfunkel.</p>

<p>As of now (July 2020) I'm currently stuck in South Korea due to COVID-19 (which is probably a good thing). I'll be moving back to the US in a year or two.</p>

## A bit more...

I was a math teacher in the US for a few years before deciding it was time to move on to a new career. I wanted a career "in the cloud," so I started learning web development on sites like Codecademy, Udemy, and [FreeCodeCamp.org](https://freecodecamp.org). I even went to a JavaScript bootcamp in Indiana, where I learned React, Angular, Node, git, and a lot more. I've done a little bit of freelancing while searching for a full-time job.

But this site is my non-techie blog, so topics will include life, photography, my experiences and observations. I do all my web-development writing at [Dev.to](https://dev.to).

## For tech-nerds

I built this site with a static site generator, [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/). I also considered Gatsby (React), Gridsome (Vue), but decided to go with Eleventy because of speed, and after experimenting, I enjoyed developing with just MarkDown and Nunjucks templating (with no CMS). This site is hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com).
