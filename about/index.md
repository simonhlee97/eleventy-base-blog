<p>Born in Korea ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡·, and grew up in Hoosier country (Indiana) ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸.</p>

<p>I'm in that tribe of rednecks from Indiana trapped in a Korean man's body.</p>

<p>I love basketball (Pacers), tennis, reading, coding, photography, tacos, pizza, coffee, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Simon and Garfunkel, The Office, Seinfeld, and 90s alternative rock.</p>

<p>As of now (August 2020) I'm currently stuck in South Korea due to COVID-19 (which is probably a good thing). I'll be moving back to the US in a year or two. (If Trump gets re-elected, possibly never?)</p>

## A bit more...

I was a math teacher in the US for a few years before deciding it was time to move on to a new career. I wanted a career "in the cloud," so I started learning web development on sites like Codecademy, Udemy, and [FreeCodeCamp.org](https://freecodecamp.org). I even went to a JavaScript bootcamp in Indiana, where I learned React, Angular, Node, git, and a lot more. I've done a little bit of freelancing while searching for a full-time job.

But this site is my non-techie blog, so I'm going to blog about non-nerd stuff like "life in Korea", photography, non-coding projects, and random thoughts and observations. I do all my web-development writing on [Dev.to](https://dev.to).

## For tech-nerds

I built this site with a static site generator, [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/). For styling, I chose [Bulma](https://bulma.io/), which pairs perfectly for blogs. I tried out WordPress with shared hosting services like BlueHost and SiteGround, but they were too slow for my liking. I also played with Gatsby (React), Gridsome (Vue), but ultimately, decided to go with Eleventy because I didn't want to deal with a CMS and just wanted to write in Markdown (or Nunjucks). This site is hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com).
